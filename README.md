# Auto-ML-Trainer
This repository provides a user-friendly platform where you can upload your dataset (Excel or CSV), perform data transformations, and apply various Machine Learning algorithms without needing to write any code.It also has registry and login page

BACKGROUND
As students, we encountered a common challenge when learning and applying Machine Learning algorithms: the lack of tools that allow us to run algorithms and transform data without getting into the complexities of coding. We wanted to focus on understanding and analyzing the results rather than struggling with the implementation. There was no simple platform that allowed us to upload a dataset and experiment with different algorithms easily.In this the user can adjust the different parameters of the machine learning algorithms and can download the result of the algorithms.
